# Collection of Scripts

Collection of custom scripts for penetration testing, just to make my life easier, these are highly unlikely to be useful for anyone else, since most were created to solve some sort of CTF problem.

## List of Scripts

  * command
    * clews.cmd - command line enumeration for windows, pun on clues, based on JAWS, future version to include AD domain enum.
    * range_ping.cmd - batch script using for loop to specify a range based on input of in /24 network to ping, can be improved.
  * powershell
    * port-scan.ps1 - simple network TCP port scanner in Powershell for network recon with nmap or other tools, used to by-pass application whitelisting where Powershell was permitted. Scans a single target, which needs to be specified in the script.
  * shell: collection of shells
    * shell-batch.cmd - batch script to provide a slightly interactive shell where cmd.exe is prevented from running, only useful for initial manual interactive recon. This was created for recon a VDI environment where Powershell, Powershell ISE and command prompt were blocked, but batch files were still permitted.
  * web: scripts for web testing
    * web-json-web-token.py - python script to decode/encode JSON web tokens.
    * web-linux-path-trav.py - python script to attempt brute force dir traversal.
    * web-urlencode.py - python script to make is easier to encode on command line.
    * web-urldecode.py - python script to make is easier to decode on command line.
